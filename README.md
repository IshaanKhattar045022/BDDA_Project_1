*Project Description:*

This project involved creating a MySQL database for a logistics company using a top-down approach. Initially, the tables were defined directly in SQL to represent the core entities of the logistics operation, including Customers, Employees, Warehouses, Vehicles, Routes, Shipments, Packages, Inventory, and Deliveries. Following the table creation, an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was produced to visually represent the relationships between these tables. After establishing the database structure and relationships, sample data was inserted into each table to simulate the company’s logistics processes.
